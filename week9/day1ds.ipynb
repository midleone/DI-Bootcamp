        "This suggests that there is virtually no linear relationship between the review ratings given by customers and the number of their previous purchases.\n",

        "Relationship Between Product Reviews and Customer Loyalty:\n",
        "Highlight the lack of a strong correlation between review ratings and repeat purchases.\n",
